# NLTK-with-IMDB-Data
Bag of Words (BOW)  and TF_IDF preprocessing methods are  applied for prediction of sentiment analysis in IMDB dataset. Only Randomforest Classification is applied. We got same accuracy in both BOW and TF_IDF. However max_features in TF_IDF made increase in accuracy of the model from 85% to 86%. Both tf_idf and random_forest models are pickled.
